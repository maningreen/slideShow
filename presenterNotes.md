# Title Slide

This is my presentation on the theme of *Farenheit 451*

Before we begin, i've got a question for you. **transition to next slide**

## What do you do?

What do you do that you enjoy?

What do you create that you enjoy?

*Do* you create anything?

please, a show of hands of people who have a creative medium of which to express themselves,
if you don't know what I just said, you probably don't.

I create things in my passtime.
I write, I program, I do math, I make things you can interact with.
I make art.
I view a lot of things as an art.

A passtime that I would not consider art is scrolling.
I put in at most 100 hours into scrolling short form content, then I realized it hindered me creating, so I stopped.

100 sounds like a lot, but in context, it goes quickly.
Chances are you have put in 10 hours of scrolling this week so far, and have done this for the past couple of months.
40 hours a month, and that's being conservative, in only 2.5 months, that's 100 hours.

When you only take in, you only consume, and you don't create.

In the story the people are TODO: find the quote saying "ppl are stuffed full of random info" search for beatty's rant and the beginning of the book
talk about how one should "stuff your eyes full of wonder, it's better than anything made in a factory"
