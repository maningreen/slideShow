# Title Slide

This is my presentation on the themes of *Farenheit 451*, in particular content and time.

Before we begin, i've got a question for you. **transition to next slide**

### What do you do?

What do you do that you enjoy?

What do you create that you enjoy?

*Do* you create anything?

please, a show of hands of people who have a creative medium of which to express themselves,
if you don't know what I just said, you probably don't.

I create things in my passtime.
I write, I program, I do math, I make things you can interact with.
I make art.
I view a lot of things as an art.

A passtime that I would not consider art is scrolling. (I am going to say a lot about short form content)
I put in at most 100 hours into scrolling short form content, then I realized it hindered me creating, so I stoppedm

100 sounds like a lot, but in context, it goes quickly.
Chances are you have put in 10 hours of scrolling this week so far, and have done this for the past couple of months.
40 hours a month, and that's being conservative, in only 2.5 months, that's 100 hours.

When you only take in, you only consume, and you don't create.

I find mindless consumption to be vile myself, yet sometimes i succumb to it,

### the first quote

"""
something something beatty's rant, read it out
"""

The part of the story here (for context if you forgot), is that montag called in sick and beatty pays him a visit in order to
    - wish him good health
    - "i know you're reading books, but the people don't want to"

And a part of it is about how the people would rather do the easy thing and simply intake crushed up content, ready for them to take, rather than a solid form, which requires chewing
There's some irony here, when i was reading the book, occasionally i would look up to make sure the world hadn't exploded yet,
but I saw something I found quite funny: people had phones in front of the books and were scrolling whilst we were reading a book specifically criticizing this mindless ingest of "content". and yes it was reels

### the second

"""
'I hate a Roman named Status Quo!' he said to me. 'Stuff your eyes full of wonder,' he said, '... See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories... \[otherwise you'll\] be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day, sleeping its life way, to hell with that,' he said, 'shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass.'
""" (150)

Little bit of background (again) in case you forgot, this quote is from when granger is telling montag about his grandfather, and some of his philosiphies.

I think this is true, I love this fictional grandfather's philosiphies, and I think they're something to live by.

I believe that creating a positive impact on people, the world is the best thing you can do in your lifetime.

You might not be written in textbooks, but chances are you'll meet someone who might, so you might as well impact them well.

One of my favourite lines in this quote is "I hate a Roman named Status Quo!", or in other words "I hate the status quo!"
I hate conforming, it's boring, you can probably tell, i'm weird. My friends are all different, and weird, and sometimes really embarrasing, but one of them said this, which I find very accurate "Life's a lot more boring when you treat everythng as cringe", I want to live by this.

I got two \[irking\] brothers who make fun of everything and everything they can, and all i can think is "wow how do they live like this", because they don't have any personality to them, or anything unique to them, besides their music tastes. And even then it's nothing to write home about, one of them is rap/hip-hop (i'm not too well versed in this genre, so i'm unsure of any specific artists), and the other only listens to tyler the creator, and that's it.

Is this ok? yes, sure, is it saddening to say "the only thing i know about my brothers are their preferences is their music.", they haven't much other personality.

I've seen people who are all alike, and i finally figured out why they're happy with their friends: "they like their friends because they're all the same", i like my friends because they're all different, when one of them is missing, i'm not just missing another one of the many, i'm missing a part of the dynamic.

### the third :)

"""
Can you dance faster than the White Clown, shout louder than 'Mr. Gimmick' and the parlor 'families'? 
If you can, you'll win your way, Montag. 
In any event, you're a fool. 
People are having *fun*
""" (83)

People are having fun, but they aren't happy.
"It was a pleasure to burn", yet it wasn't a joy to.

In a life so fast, so quick, so impatient, it's hard not to have fun, one thing to the next, faster, faster, can you run quicker? how about we slope the ground, you're working with gravity!, so let's keep making it steeper and steeper, let's keep running as fast as you can, and time's right behind you!, don't want it to catch up do you?, so let's keep going, let's keep running, you may run faster than time but, alas, it doesn't sleep.

With everything going so fast one doesn't stop for a minute and take a picture of the wonderful sunsets or clouds.
For if they did, they'd realize how fast they ran down the track, and how little is left, and that's quite a hard pill to swallow, 
it's a good thing it isn't prescribed.

Ever feel like life's a blur? Me too.
Feel like your memory's worse than a block of wood is as a sponge? Me too.
I don't want to look back behind me, and see how far I've gone, because as far as I'm aware I've been on the track for only a few minutes.
Four laps a year, and I'm rearing behind 15 miles already.

### wow those were some really neato quotes, what of it?

Make things,
make dumb things,
make dumb things that show -- not hide -- yourself,
make dumb things that show yourself and maybe next time you'll make something a tidbit better.
